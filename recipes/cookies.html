        <!-- Ingredients -->
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>3/4 cup packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
            <li>1 cup chopped nuts (optional, e.g., walnuts or pecans)</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Steps -->
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, beat together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
            <li>Add the vanilla extract and eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add this dry mixture to the wet ingredients, mixing until combined.</li>
            <li>Stir in the chocolate chips (and nuts, if using).</li>
            <li>Drop rounded tablespoon-sized balls of cookie dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart.</li>
            <li>Bake for 9-11 minutes or until the edges are golden but the centers are still soft. The cookies will firm up as they cool.</li>
            <li>Let the cookies cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring them to wire racks to cool completely.</li>
        </ol>
