# Project Name: Recipe Website

## Introduction

This project is a simple web application designed to allow users to browse recipes. The application provides functionality for users to view detailed recipe information.

The goal of this project is to build a bare bones fully functional recipe website, which involves working with basic HTML and CSS. By completing this project, I will have demonstrated my ability to:

- **Structure a website** using HTML and CSS.
- **Design a responsive layout** that works across different screen sizes.
- **Debug common issues** and improve the user experience through testing and iteration.
